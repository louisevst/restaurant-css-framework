# restaurant-css-framework

Exercice for beCode with the point to learn php.

We had to add to our fictive restaurant site a backoffice.

To access the backoffice you must go to http://localhost:4000/backoffice/login.php.

You can click [here](https://louisevst.github.io/restaurant-css-framework/) to see it live ! (but this version doesn't have the php part)
